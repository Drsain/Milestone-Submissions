# Milestone-Submissions
A Repository for the people in the group Orange to condense and eventually submit Milestone's for our project.

Project description:

NetWorth is a web based app that calculates a user's net worth with the calculation: total assets - total liabilities = net worth. The user creates their own account that they can log in and out of, add data to, edit their data, and share their data with a friend via email.
